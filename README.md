# Study: Stack & Queue

This is an example of a basic stack and queue data structure implementation in C++ based on a University tutorial.

Disclaimer: this implementation is available as a reference resource and a portfolio piece for myself. Whilst I have no problems with anyone studying or learning what a stack and queue does and how they operate with this solution, it is not intended to be used as your homework or assignment.
